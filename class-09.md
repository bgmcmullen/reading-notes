# Class 09 Reading Notes:

Forms are important in web design because they are one of the fundamental ways to collect input from the user to send back to the server.\
\
A form needs to be as concise as possible otherwise it may confused the user.\
\
"form" this element is the container for the form.\
"label" will label each input field.\
"input" is the element that will actually take in data from the user.\
"textarea" is similar to "input" but it must be closed with and end tag and "input" does not.\
"button" is simply a button for the user to click on.\
\
Anytime you interact with your computer and it response that is an event.\
\
An event listener needs two arguments, what event to listen for and a function to execute when that event happens.\
\
An event object is an object the browser creates for each event. It contains the relevant information for the event but the contents may be different depending on the event. The target property is the element that the event occurred to.\
\
Event bubbling is the standard way that the browser handles listeners on parent elements. The listener also applies to child elements. When event capturing is enabled it works the other way with the child element's listener applying to the parent.\

## Things I want to know more about
