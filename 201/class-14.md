# Class 14 Reading Notes:
\
Transforms allow a developer to alter the size and position of elements in both 2D and 3D.\
\
Rotate allows you to rotate an element on all three axes. This could be useful to create and animation to make an element spin.\
\
CSS transitions allow the developer to make html elements' appearance change at the change of a state without the use of JavaScript.\
\
Animations work similarly to transitions but allow the element to change across multiple keyframes and can even make a continuous animation.\
\
CSS transitions are a simple way to make your webpage more visually appealing and add interactivity.\
\
It is certainly important to me to make professional and appealing looking websites and I think transitions and animations could be very useful for this.\

## Things I want to know more about.
Are there accessibility guidelines that must be followed when using transitions and animations.
