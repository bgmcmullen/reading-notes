# Class 10 Reading Notes:\
\
A syntax error occurs when the code is not typed correctly and it cannot run. A logi error occurs when the code executes but gives incorrect results. A syntax error is usually simply a matter of correcting a typo but a logic error is much more difficult to correct.\
\
The most common errors I have been getting seem to be because a variable is undefined because the code that was supposed to assign it did not execute. I can usually solve this with console.log so I can figure out what code is not executing.\
\
I realize my goal cannot be to always write code without errors because that is not realistic. My goal is to get better a troubleshooting.\
\
The JS Debugger tool allows the coder to see what is happening in the code in more detail. It lets you see what is happening in what order and what is going wrong.\
\
A breakpoint is a point you set where the program will stop and let you see the status of what is happening.\
\
The call stack shows you what code had been executed to get to the current line of code.\

## Things I want to know more about.
Are there other types of errors?
