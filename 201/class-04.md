# Class 04 Reading Notes:

For a basic link the text is put in an "a" element.\
\
The href attribute contains the url you are linking to.\
\
To make a link accessible the text should be descriptive not just Click here, it should not it's self be the url, should not use the word link, it should be concise, and whenever possible each link on a page should have unique text.\
\
Normal flow refers to the way elements on a webpage are laid out by default if you do not change them.\
\
An inline element is simply the size of it's content but a block-level element will take up the entire horizontal space in its parent element.\
\
Static positioning is the default for every html element.\
\
Absolute position can be useful for a user interface that is not supposed to get in the way of other elements on the page.\
\
Absolute positioning positions an element relative to its parent element. Fixed positioning works on the same principle as absolute positioning except is positioned relative to the users view not the entire page. Basically it does not scroll. However this is not the case if the parent element is fixed.\
\
A function declaration is where you define what the function does but it does not make the function run. A function invocation makes the function run.\
\
Argument is another word for a parameter. They can also be called properties or attributes.\
\
Job interview readiness:\
To succeed in a job interview you not only need to understand the relevant skills but also be able to communicate them effectively. So far I am understanding the concepts in this class without too much issue. However, communicating the concepts to others will likely be much more of a challenge. Working with others will force me to practice this.\
\
Work environment readiness:\
Being good at writing code is not the only thing you need to be a good employee. Companies will want a good collaborator and pair programming is a great way to practice this.


## Things I want to know more about

While I understand the concept of normal flow I could not look at an HTML file and tell you how it will be laid out in a browser. I hope that with more practice I will get a better intuitive sense of how HTML elements are laid out.
