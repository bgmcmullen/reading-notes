# Class 07 Reading Notes:

Domain modeling is writing code to create a conceptual model  to solve a specific problem.\
\
HTML tables should not be used for page layout because accessibility tools like screen readers will get confused, it can make the code hard for a human to read, and the table's width does not get set to the same as the parent element by default.\
\
Inside a "table" element you can use "th" for a header "tr" for a row and "td" for a table cell.\
\
A constructor is a function called with "new" that will build and return a new object. This is much more efficient than using object literals.\
\
In an object literal "this" simply refers to the object it is in but in a constructor it refers to the specific instance of the object.\
\
A prototype is like a key signature in music notation. If I add an f-sharp in the key signature then each instance of the note "f" inherits that sharp.\

## Things I want to know more about
I would like to know how to make a table as accessible as possible.
