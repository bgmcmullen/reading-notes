# Class 14 Psychological Safety Reading Notes:
\
One of the most important factors of psychological safety is respect for boundaries. People should be expected to work hard during their work hours but should not be expected to work additional hours without this being discussed prior. Also very important are active listening and fostering creativity.\
\
In the class many of the students mentioned times they had to deal with an authoritarian supervisor who did not respect anyone else's opinion. Obviously that is horrible, but I have often had the opposite problem. For example as a music theory instructor my supervisor was extremely nice and wanted to give everyone a chance to speak but never wanted to make decisions. This lead to a disorganized environment.\
\
I think one thing that really makes companies with a high degree of psychological safety stand out is their long term success. They are more likely to retain employees and achieve more as they work toward their long term goals.
