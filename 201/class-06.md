# Class 06 Reading Notes:

I would describe an object like an encyclopedia with a tab to retrieve each piece of content.\
\
An object literal is very useful if you want to contain a cluster of information without creating a new variable for each piece of data\
\
An object is similar to an array but the values are accessed by name rather than number and do not have an order.\
\
You would need to use bracket notation to access a value in an object if the name you are giving it is in a variable.\
\
"This" refers to the object it is contained within. This can simplify your coding if you are creating multiple similar objects.\
\
DOM stands for document object model. This is the interface used for programming web documents and it is where HTML CSS and JS come together.\
\
The DOM is not a programming language but it is necessary for the programming language which is most commonly JavaScript to access the HTML CSS and any documents needed for it to build the webpage\
