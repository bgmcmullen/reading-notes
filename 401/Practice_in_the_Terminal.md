### Peace in the Terminal
## The Command Line 
A command line is simply a text interface with a computer system. How we get to one will depend on the operating system. Inside the terminal, we work within a shell; the most common type of shell is BASH (Bourne Again Shell).
## Basic Navigation 
pwd – this will give you the directory of your current file location.\
ls - will list the content of the current directory.\
cd – this is used to change directories.
## More About Files
In Linux, essentially everything is considered a file. Unlike many systems, Linux does not have an extensionless system. Linux is case sensitive, and spaces do not work in file names in Linux. It also has hidden files and directories; we can use -a to view them.
## Manual Pages 
Manual pages are accessed using the man command. These pages contain every command on this system and what they do.
## File Manipulation
We can add or remove a directory with mkdir or rmdir. Touch creates a file, cp copies, mv moves a file, and rm removes a file.
