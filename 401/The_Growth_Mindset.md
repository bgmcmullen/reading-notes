# The Growth Mindset:


This growth mindset is a very powerful way of thinking that can apply to any kind of learning. I agree that this is a very powerful tool. I really liked the way these videos separated the idea of intelligence from success. It is so important to understand that success is not just about intelligence but more about a particular mindset. I think that in tech, this way of thinking applies very strongly since it is a very quickly changing field that requires us all to be lifelong learners. There is not a huge difference in scores on the emotional intelligence bias surveys, but I think one that is important to note is that through working on the self-paced coding courses, I really emphasized to myself that I can keep going on a project, despite obstacles.
