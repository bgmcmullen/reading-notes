# Class 32 Reading Notes:

## Scaling Up with Reducer and Context
### 1. How do useReducer and useContext work together to simplify state management in a React application? 
In a React app, useReducer and useContext can be used in conjunction to simplify state management by centralizing logic and making it accessible in all components. This is useful for managing state transitions in a predictable way, particularly with multiple related state variables.\
Combining these two hooks also enhances state management by making it possible to share a global state without dreaded prop drilling. useContext provides a way to pass data through the component tree without having to pass props down manually.
