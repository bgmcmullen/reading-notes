# Class 10 Reading Notes:


### What native Node.js module allows us to get started with Event Driven Programming?
EventEmitter
### What is the value of Object-Oriented Programming used in tandem with Event Driven Programming?
Event-driven programming allows the coder to review the flow of information between objects and contain an object's behavior in itself.
### Consider your knowledge of Event Driven Programming in the Web Browser, now explain to a non-technical friend how Event Driven Programming might be useful on the backend using Node.js.

Event-driven programming is like having a private event planner coordinating everything behind the scenes. This allows Node.js to handle multiple events at once.
