# Class 02 Reading Notes:

## An introduction to Node.js and Express
1.	Explain middleware, as if explaining to a non-technical recruiter.
Middleware facilitates smooth communication between software applications.
2.	Express is the most popular _____. 
Node.js web framework.
3.	Express is “unopinionated.” What does that mean? 
Unlike opinionated frameworks, unopinionated frameworks have fewer restrictions on how they can be used to facilitate communication.
4.	What is a module and why is modularity useful to us as developers? 
A module is a file of code we import into another. This allows us to organize our code into manageable parts.
What is npm?
1.	What version of npm are you running on your machine?
2.	10.5.0
3.	What command would you type to install a library/package called ‘jshint’ into your node project? 
4.	npm install jshint
## What is TDD?
1.	Explain why tests are important, as if explaining to your non-technical elder. 
Tests allow us to continually ensure our project functions properly as we build the program.
2.	What are three expected benefits of testing?
•	To reduce the likelihood of defects during development
•	Reduced time and effort in the final stages of development
•	Potentially higher quality design
3.	Name at least 2 individual pitfalls and at least 2 team pitfalls commonly encountered while writing tests. Individual pitfalls:
•	Writing too many tests
•	Testing trivial code
## CI/CD
1.	What are three benefits of Continuous Integration?
•	Detect issues with the code early on in the development process
•	Quickly detect issues in the code.
•	Stronger final product.
2.	What is the difference between Continuous Delivery and Continuous Deployment?
In Continuous Delivery, the project is built, tested, and prepared for deployment automatically. Continuous Deployment takes a step further and deploys the project automatically.
3.	Explain how GitHub fits into this process assuming the listener comes from a non-technical background.
GitHub or other similar tools allow team members to assemble their code in one central repository.
