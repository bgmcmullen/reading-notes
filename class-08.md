# Class 08 Reading Notes:

Flexbox does not work like a grid. Elements can be aligned on the vertical or horizontal axis but not both. This is why it is called one-dimensional.\
\
The main axis is the horizontal axis while the cross axis is the vertical axis. The main axis is  set with "flex-direction".\
\
Any flexbox property that changes the visual order of elements should be used carefully as it does not change the logical order. This means that screen readers will not follow the new visual order you have set.\
\
Floats have limitations. Before the creation of flexbox it was hard to center content in a parent  element, make all child elements take the same amount of space or make multiple columns with differently sized content take the same amount of space.\
\
It is hard to say exactly how this relates to my long term goals yet but I certainly want to make good looking websites and reading about flexbox is starting to give a clearer idea of how this can be done.

## Things I want to know more about
When is flexbox not appropriate and what alternatives can be used?
