# Class 03 Reading Notes:\
\
An unordered list is used when the items in the list do not have a numerical order. They will likely be displayed as a bulleted list.\
\
The bullet type is changed with CSS using list-style-type.\
\
An ordered list is used when the items in the list need to be labeled in order likely with numbers or letters.\
\
You can changed the numbers in an ordered list by using the start attribute to change what value the list starts at or the type attribute to change what symbols are used to number the list.\
\
The margin is the outer layer providing a barrier between the border and other objects. The padding exists inside the border and provides a barrier between the content and the border.\
\
The parts of the box model are the content box, the padding box, the border box, and the margin box.\
\
JS arrays can contain strings, numbers or objects.\
\
Yes the people array is a valid array containing arrays. You can access the values with people[] add the index of the element you want to access in the brackets and if you want to access a value inside one of the arrays in the people array you would type people[][] adding the index of  the array in the array you want to access.\
\
Here are five shorthand operators y += x (assigns the value of y + x) , x -= f() (assigns the value of y - x), x *= f() (assigns the value of y * x), x /= f(), (assigns the value of y / x)\
\
let a = 10;\
 let b = 'dog';\
 let c = false;\
\
 // evaluate this\
 (a + c) + b;\
\
This would evaluate to a string: 10dog. First the parentheses are evaluated. False casts to a number and becomes 0 so 10+0 is 10. Then 10 is cast to a string and is concatenated with dog and we get 10dog.\
\
You could use a conditional if...else statement to write code to determine if the user has answered a question correctly. If they have they would be congratulated if not they would be told to try again.\
\
Loops are very common. The are used basically any time you need the same code to be repeated multiple times often with the variables changing each time.\

## Things I want to know more about\

While I think I have a good basic understanding of how the box model works I don't yet have a clear idea of the best practices to use this model to make esthetically effective websites.
