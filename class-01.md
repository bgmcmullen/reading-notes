# Class 01 Reading Notes:
When searching for a website how does it begin?\
The browser must first find the web address on the DNS.\
The browser then sends an HTTP message to the server.\
This message requests the website be sent from the server to client.\
TCP/IP is the method for this.\
If this server approves it sends the website to the browser.\
The browser displays it in small pieces.\
