# Class 05 Reading Notes:

The purpose of the "alt" attribute is to give a text description of an image that will be displayed if the browser is unable to display the image or it will be read by a screen reader.\
\
To make images in an HTML document you should avoid the title attribute, you should give it a caption with "figcaption" and make sure it has "alt" text.\
\
The figure element is used when you need a container for a image or some other self-contained content and you will probably use "figcaption" to add a caption.\
\
GIF which stands for Graphics Interchange Format contains specific information about the color of each pixel in the image where as svg Scalable Vector Graphics contains source code that tells how the image should be drawn.\
\
A PNG file is best for screenshots because you want a lossless format.\
\
The background color is the color of the background area of the space that that html element takes on the page and the foreground color changes the color of the text in that element.\
\
If I were coloring a website first I would choose a base color that is appropriate to the subject matter of the blog. Then I'd flush it out with additional colors making sure it fits color accessibility guidelines.\
\
When choosing fonts it is important to make sure all of your fonts will be available to all users. This means making sure a web safe font is available but we may want other choices of fonts so it is a good idea to use font stacks to make sure the browser has an alternative that is web safe.\
\
Font size sets the size of the font. Font weight adjusts how bold the font is. Font style sets if the font is italic.\
\
You can add spacing between letters with word spacing or letter spacing.\
