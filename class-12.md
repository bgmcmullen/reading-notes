# Class 12 Reading Notes:
\
"Canvas" is used to make a place on a website to create 2D graphics with JavaScript.\
\
"Canvas" requires a closing tag "/Canvas". Everything inside the tags will the fallback content.\
\
The getContext() method takes an argument and returns a render context object.\
\
Chart.js is a library of JS for creating visual charts to display data. It can be brought into your project by adding a link to the script in your html and then adding a new Chart object in your JS and adding your data to that object.\
\
Chart.js can create bar charts, bubble charts, line charts and many others.\
\
Charts are generally a better way of presenting data than tables since you can see the proportions without having to read every number.\
\
Charts.js is going to be very useful for the odd-duck project since it will allow the data to be viewed visually.\

## Things I want to know more about.
Is it possible to create charts from scratch with your own JS?
