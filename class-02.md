# Class 02 Reading Notes:
While it is possible to fight against the typical use of semantic elements using style this is bad practice. It will not have the advantage of being viewed as having the specific intended purpose of the specific semantic element both by other developers and the web browser.\
\
HTML has six heading elements.\
\
Sub and sup elements are for subscript and superscript. These are used for things like numbers in dates, exponents, or numbers in chemical elements.\
\
The abbr element is used to contain an abbreviation or acronym. Typically this would be nested inside another element like p or maybe h1 or another header. You can use the title attribute to provide the full expansion.\
\
There are three ways to add CSS, inline(should be used sparingly) an internal stylesheet, or an external stylesheet(most common)\
\
Inline CSS works but it is clunky particularly if you are applying the same style to multiple elements. You would have to repeat the same CSS and you'd have to change it in multiple places every time you wanted to edit the style.\
\
In this CSS block the selector is targeting anything in the h2(heading 2) element. "color: black"; and "padding: 5px;" are declarations. Color and padding are properties.\
\
In JS single quotes contain a string.\
\
Addition "+", subtraction "-" assignment "=" and does not equal "!==" are all JS operators.\
\
Let's say you are trying to determine if a square and triangle have the same area. You could write a function that takes the dimensions of the two shapes performs the necessary arithmetic to calculate the areas and compares the numbers. If they are the same it will return true if not  it will return false.\
\
An if statement checks a condition and if it evaluates to true, then the code block will execute.\
\
An else if is used if you want to evaluate a second condition after evaluating the previous condition to be false.\
\
Here are three comparison operators; < "is lest than" > "is greater than" <= "is equal to or less than".\
\
&& Will only return true if all elements are true. || Will return true if at least one element is true.



## Things I want to know more about
I would like to know more about when the abbr element is typically used.
Are there specific times when inline styles are best?
Why can single and double quotes both be used for strings but they are not necessarily interchangeable?
