# Class 05 Reading Notes:

I would describe an object like an encyclopedia with a tab to retrieve each piece of content.\
\
An object literal is very usefully if you want to contain a cluster of information without creating a new constant for each piece of data\
\
An object is similar to an array but the values are accessed by name rather than number and do not have an order.\
\
You would need to use bracket notation to access a value in an object if the name you are giving it is in a variable.\
\
"This" refers to the object in is contained within. This can simplify your coding if you are creating multiple similarly objects.\
\
DOM stands for document object model. This is the interface used for programming web documents and it is where HTML CSS and JS come together.\
\
The DOM is not a programming language but it necessary for the the program language which is most commonly be JavaScript to access the HTML CSS and any document needed for it to build the webpage\
