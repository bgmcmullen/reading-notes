# Class 11 Reading Notes:
\
The introduction of Flash and Silverlight and other similar technologies was a game changer when it comes to online video and audio. These have how been replaced with the  html elements "video" and "audio".\
\
The "src" attribute works the same as in a "img" element. It allows you to give the file path to the video or audio. The "controls" attribute allows the user to use the video with the browser's built in controls.\
\
Fallback content is important because, similarly to images, it is possible that a browser will fail to open the video and the fallback content will be displayed in its place.\
\
Before the day that our characters "audio" and "video" entered the scene the landscape was dominated by Flash and Silverlight but they became old and frail and "audio" and "video" took there place. They brought their children "src" "controls" and fallback content and only work when their children are around.\
\
The main difference between grid and flexbox is that grid allows you to control content in two dimensions rather than just one.\
\
The grid container is the element that will be given the grid property and will contain all parts of the grid called the grid items. The grid lines are the vertical and horizontal dividing lines of the grid.\
\
Responsive images not only can make website function on different sized screens they can also save bandwidth by not loading in an unnecessarily large image on a screen that can't display it properly.\
\
"Srcset" gives the browser a set of images to display and their sizes. "Sizes" tells the browser what images to display under certain conditions.
\
The issue with using css or js for responsive images is that that browser downloads images before it interprets js or css so it would end up downloading the wrong images then download another image to display when it finds out the one it downloaded is not the one it is supposed to display and this is very inefficient.
