## Class 09 Reading Notes:

1. What is functional programming?\
“Functional programming is a programming paradigm — a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs — that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data”.\

2. What is a pure function and how do we know if something is a pure function? A pure function will always return the same result when given the same arguments.\
3. What are the benefits of a pure function? A pure function is much easier to test as there is no need to.\
4. What is immutability? Immutable data can't be changed after it is created.\
5. What is Referential transparency? A function that always returns the same result is referentially transparent.\
1. What is a module? A module is a JavaScript file used to contain a section of code with a particular purpose.\
2. What does the word 'require' do? Require imports a module in Node.js.\
3. How do we bring another module into the file that we are working in? To bring in another module, we need to export the parts of the module we need in another module with module.exports. Then import the module with require.\
4. What do we have to do to make a module available? module.exports.\

###Things I want to know more about:
Other than being used for Node compared to React, are there nuances of difference between what require and import do?
