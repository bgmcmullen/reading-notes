## Class 06 Reading Notes:


To what extent did psychological safety impact your previous work experience?\
\
I am lucky to have never had an abusive or rude employer who actively suppressed ideas, but I have worked in environments where there was a lack of trust, making it hard to solve workplace problems since although people were polite, they did not want to speak up.\
\
How does this article inform your approach to working with others moving forward?\
\
I agree with the quote “However, establishing psychological safety is, by its very nature, somewhat messy and difficult to implement.” But of course, that doesn’t mean that it is not important and necessary to implement. I think an important takeaway is that it is important to give yourself and your team some slack. They are human and are not perfect. Psychological safety is not an exact science and it can’t always be optimized 100% of the time.\
\
Who is Roy Fielding?\
Roy Fielding is a researcher and computer scientist who played an important role in writing the first web servers.\
\
Why don’t the techniques that we use in this class work well when we need to be able to talk to all of the machines in the world?\
Most modern techniques don’t work well communicating with all the machines because when they were invented, that was no longer considered necessary.\
\
What is the HTTP protocol that Fielding and his friends created?\
The HTTP protocol is the basis for most of the internet. It is like coordinates for data.\
\
What does a GET do?\
A GET will get data from a server to the browser.\
\
What does a POST do?\
POST adds something to another system.\
\
What does PUT do?\
PUT updates something in another system.\
\
What does PATCH do?\
PATCH does a partial update.\
\
## Things I want to know more about:
Are there techniques specific to communicating large number of machines.
