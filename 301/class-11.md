## Class 11 Reading Notes:

SQL: has a predefined schema. NoSQL: has a dynamic schema.\
SQL: is vertically scalable. NoSQL: is horizontally scalable.\
SQL: emphasizes the ACID properties. NoSQL follows Brewer's CAP theorem.\
SQL: is the best fit for heavy-duty transactional type applications. NoSQL: is not comparable and stable enough for high load and complex transactional applications.\

1. Structured data is a good fit for an SQL database.\
2. A customer management system is a good fit for an SQL database.\
3. Unstructured data is a good fit for a NoSQL database.\
4. A social media platform is a good fit for a NoSQL database.\
5. NoSQL databases are a better fit for hierarchical data storage.\
6. Which type of database is best for scalability depends on what type of scalability you are going for. SQL databases are vertically scalable, and NoSQL databases are horizontally scalable.\
1. SQL stands for Structured Query Language.\
2. A relational database has multiple data tables with relationships between them.\
3. A schema is the organizational blueprint of a database.\
4. Relational databases work well with tables.\
5. A NoSQL database is a non-tabular database that can store large amounts of data.\
6. A NoSQL database contains collections which contain documents.\
7. In a NoSQL database, all the data is in one place, although there can be multiple clusters.\
8. NoSQL is more flexible as it is schema-less.\
9. NoSQL databases typically can work across multiple servers.\


### Things I want to know more about:
Are there other types of databases that are commonly used?
