PUT
2. Which REST methods require an ID parameter?
DELETE and PUT
3. Whatâ€™s the relationship between REST and CRUD?
REST APIs have a similar function to CRUD, but it is not a one-to-one relationship, as REST includes more than just the CRUD functions.
4. If you had to describe the process of creating a RESTful API in 5 steps, what would they be?
Design the API, choose a framework, implement endpoints, handle requests and responses, deploy.
